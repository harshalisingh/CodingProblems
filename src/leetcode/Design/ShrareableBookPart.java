/*Assume that there is an e-book application. For every book the sharable part of the book content cannot exceed 10% of the whole book. 
 * Design a module to decide whether the current part of content is sharable. 
 * 
 * if there are two paragraphs of the book content with the exact same texts, as long as they are not in the same place, 
 * they would be considered different content. 
 * I then realized itâ€™s a question about merging segments - have a helper to find each pair of start and end point of the input content 
 * (given multiple separated paragraphs). Then merge the intervals and see if they combined exceed 10% of the entire book.
